# Build plan

The work still ahead: phases not yet built, owner checkpoints still pending, and ideas for later.
Agents work through it phase by phase, mostly unattended, and stop only at **hardware
checkpoints**, where the owner has to try something on the DAC Mac, the Denon, a phone, or the
2015 MacBook Pro.

Finished phases, 1 to 84 apart from 10 and 13, are in
[plan-archive.md](plan-archive.md), with their implementation plans, Result lines and the full
text of each checkpoint.

Each phase ends with the [phase gate](#phase-gate): review, performance audit, and architecture
check. A phase isn't done until its gate passes.

## How to run it

Start a session with "run the next phase of docs/plan.md". For several phases unattended, say "use
a workflow to run phases N–M of docs/plan.md". For each phase, the orchestrating agent:

1. **Plans.** It reads the phase, the code it touches, and `docs/map.md`, then writes a short
   implementation plan under the phase heading: files, modules, tests, and order. It does a
   search first (map.md recipes), so it extends existing code instead of writing a second copy.
   Earlier phases' plans in the archive are the pattern to follow.
2. **Implements** on a branch `phase/<n>-<slug>` with an Opus subagent (per the owner's
   CLAUDE.md), in small commits. Each commit passes `./scripts/check --changed main`
   (AGENTS.md), which the implementer also iterates with.
3. **Runs the phase gate.** The reviewers and auditors are Sonnet subagents running in parallel.
   It fixes every confirmed finding, checking each fix with `./scripts/check --changed main`.
   No subagent runs the full gate: the orchestrator runs `./scripts/check` once, in the branch's
   worktree just before step 4, and its test step reruns only the test targets edited since
   their last pass. Fast-forwarding main to the branch then carries that pass's test stamp into
   main's checkout (`scripts/post-merge`).
4. **Records.** It ticks the phase's boxes, adds a "Result" line with measured numbers and what
   the phase cost (each subagent's tokens, tool calls and wall time), commits, and fast-forwards
   `main` to the branch. It never pushes.
5. **Archives.** It moves the finished phase, unchanged, to the end of the archive's phases. A
   checkpoint the phase leaves pending gets a line in [Waiting on the owner](#waiting-on-the-owner)
   pointing at the archived text.
6. **Looks back** every third phase archived since the last
   [retrospective](#retrospective), and runs one.
7. **Continues.** A hardware checkpoint doesn't stop the run. It's recorded as pending, and the
   run moves on to the next phase that doesn't depend on its result. When the run ends, it lists
   every pending checkpoint at once: what to push, what to run on which machine, and what to
   paste back.

If something blocks a phase that only the owner can resolve (a product decision, missing
hardware, an Apple API that can't do what the phase assumes), stop and ask. Don't work around it.

### Current run order

Set by the owner on 2026-11-11. Earlier run orders are in the archive.

1. Phase 85, what phase 84 left, waits until the owner starts it.
2. Phases 10 and 13 wait. Phase 10 adds pairing tokens, a secret, so the owner decides how
   they're stored first (AGENTS.md).

## Waiting on the owner

Checkpoints and answers from finished phases. Each links to its phase in the archive, which has
the full steps. When the owner clears one, tick its box in the archive, add what was found to
that phase's Result line, and delete its line here.

  the error text.
- **39** ([phase](plan-archive.md#39-owner-feedback-2026-11-03-evening)): whether selected rows
  show their row line, and whether "the first column on the right" counts from the center, as
  now, or from the window's edge.

## Phase gate

Run after every phase, before ticking it off.

- [ ] **Gate:** the full `./scripts/check` passes, run once by the orchestrator just before
      landing (step 3). In an agent session `theGlassHeadersAreFrosted` fails
      on main too (the screen reads back as 0), so it alone doesn't fail the gate. A test
      target that fails on timing while other phases run (`RendererOutputTests`, a search
      during a refresh) is rerun with `./scripts/check test`, which runs only the targets that
      failed, before the failure is called the branch's.
- [ ] **Code review:** `/code-review high` on the phase branch. Fix confirmed findings in
      their own commits, then rerun the review until it finds nothing new above low severity.
- [ ] **Simplify:** `/simplify` on the same branch. Look especially for duplication across modules
      and for abstractions with one caller.
- [ ] **Performance audit:** `./scripts/bench` against the budgets in
      [Performance budgets](#performance-budgets). A budget miss blocks the phase. A regression
      over 10% against the last recorded result needs a fix or a written reason in the Result
      line. In an agent session the window rows that quit the app (launch, scrolling, page
      down, resize, row height) hang in `terminate:`, each for its 300 s timeout: leave them out
      by name and list them for the owner's Mac. Rerun a row that misses alone before calling
      it a miss; a full run's load can push a row past its budget. A row that errors with
      SQLite's "disk I/O error" (6922) while other phases run is rerun alone the same way, and
      the bench's app is built first for the rows that need it. A row still slower alone is
      run against main's binary, alternately, under the bench lock, before it's called a
      regression: in phase 73 four such rows read the same on main.
- [ ] **Real-time audit**, if the phase touched playback: everything reachable from the IO proc
      is C in `HALRender` and uses no locks, no allocation, no logging and no ObjC. Ring buffer
      sizing is justified in a comment.
- [ ] **Architecture audit:** `docs/map.md` still describes the tree. No module reaches around
      another (the tier check only catches tier direction). Settings are read in one place. New
      user-facing strings and constants each have one definition.
- [ ] **Docs:** an ADR in `docs/decisions/` for every non-obvious choice. AGENTS.md boundaries
      updated if the phase created something that must not be edited directly, keeping AGENTS.md
      under ~50 lines.
- [ ] **Result line** written: what shipped, the benchmark numbers, what the phase cost, and
      anything deferred.

## Retrospective

Every third phase, and before a long run ends, the orchestrator adds a dated entry at the top of
[retrospectives.md](retrospectives.md):

- Tokens and wall time per phase since the last entry, from the Result lines, and where they
  went: reading code, test iterations, gate runs, review rounds, waiting on probes.
- What changes because of it, in this plan, AGENTS.md, a script or a brief, with the reason.
  Make the change in the same commit as the entry.
- Cleanup: `git worktree list`, then remove every worktree no running agent is using and run
  `git worktree prune`. Each one holds a full `.build`, several gigabytes. Removing one deletes
  its `.build`, so anything a Result line points at goes in the scratchpad first.

Then `./scripts/test --fresh` and `./scripts/check`. The full run catches what the gate's
incremental test step can miss ([ADR 0122](decisions/0122-incremental-test-step.md)): a race
that shows only with the whole suite running at once.

## Performance budgets

These are targets for a 43k-track library, measured by `./scripts/bench` on the fixture library
(phase 1). "Old Mac" means the 2015 MacBook Pro on macOS 12, measured at hardware checkpoints.
Change a budget only with a reason in the Result line.

This table is the human copy. Each budget is defined in code next to its benchmark in
`Sources/Tools/Bench`, and the two change together.

## Phases

Phase 85 is what phase 84 left on 2026-11-11; phases 10 and 13 are from the original plan and haven't been built.

### 85. The file splits and the performance rerun

Left from phase 84 when the owner landed it early on 2026-11-11. Its triage (in the archive,
under [phase 84](plan-archive.md#84-a-codebase-agents-can-keep-changing-safely)) has the
detail of each item.

- [ ] **The splits** (84.29, 84.30): `AppCommands` and `AppMenus` per area in `Core/Commands`,
      then `LibraryBrowser.swift`, `AppDelegate.swift`, `TrackTableController.swift` and
      `BrowserModel.swift` along the seams the auditor drew, code moves only, with
      `size-allow.txt`'s ceilings and map.md brought down to match.
- [ ] **`DeviceOutput`'s mutation entries** (84.8), by ranges of about 150 mutants, with tests
      for the survivors that matter.
- [ ] **Performance rerun** (84.31): on a quiet machine, alternating with main's binary, Analyze
      1741 first, then Approve local, Apply to All, the over-budget and tight rows and the
      playback rows.
- [ ] **Code review** of phase 84's 52 commits, which landed without one: `/code-review high`
      on `5fb2cabe..` the landing commit, its confirmed findings fixed.

### 10. Web remote

- [ ] **API:** HTTP plus WebSocket JSON on the phase 9 server. It exposes the command registry,
      playback state, queue, library browsing and search, and pushes state changes to every
      connected client.
- [ ] **Pairing:** a code shown in the app is exchanged for a token. Clients without a token get
      nothing. LAN only, configurable port, and the whole remote can be switched off.
- [ ] **Web app:** static HTML, CSS and JS in `Support/`, with no framework and no build step,
      sized for phones. Now playing, transport, queue, browse and search.
- [ ] Several clients stay in sync with each other and with the Mac UI.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** control playback from a phone and a second computer at
      once, and pair a new device.

### 13. Release readiness

- [ ] Developer ID signing, hardened runtime and notarization in `scripts/bundle release`.
      Secrets come from 1Password at that point, so this phase adds the secrets setup it removed.
- [ ] First-run flow: choose watched folders and the output device.
- [ ] Accessibility pass: VoiceOver labels on the table, transport and palette.
- [ ] An app icon and an About window.
- [ ] Remove the **Pre-release** boundary from AGENTS.md if this is the first public release, and
      decide how stored data will be migrated from then on.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** a clean install on the 2015 MacBook Pro and the DAC Mac
      from a notarized build.

## Later

Not phases yet. Each becomes one when the owner asks.

- **The matcher's memory** (phase 73, E3 and E4): after Analyze of 1,741 albums whose masters
  have 20 to 100 releases, 290 to 330 MB stays held, because each candidate keeps its whole
  scored tracklist, artists and credits, and each is decoded whole when scoring needs only
  the tracks. Keep only what the review reads; the matcher row measures it.
- **A control thread that sleeps until it's due** (phase 73, A1): while playing it wakes every
  10 ms, about 0.28% of a core; waking for the next segment boundary, half-empty ring or drain
  deadline instead needs an ADR beside 0029.

- **Mini player:** a small window with art, transport and seek.
- **Library folder:** files dropped on the window are copied into it
  ([ADR 0124](decisions/0124-drop-files-and-the-library-folder.md)), and phase 60 keeps it
  organized when tags change ([ADR 0164](decisions/0164-keep-files-organized.md)). Move and
  Consolidate Library move and rename music files from outside it, which AGENTS.md doesn't
  allow, so they need an ADR and the owner's go-ahead first.
- **LLM review of incomplete matches:** after phase 51, a model reads an Incomplete album's
  files and its candidates and proposes a release and a mapping, which lands in Likely for the
  user to review. Needs the model, its key and what is sent decided first.
- **Live visualizer (TBD):** a spectrum of what's playing, asked for on 2026-11-05 with phase 45
  and put off. The decoder thread would copy what it decodes into a second ring buffer
  (`Sources/Primitives/RingBuffer`) before the device's ring, so the IO proc and the
  bit-perfect path don't change, and do nothing while no view shows it. The view draws bars
  or a line on a log frequency axis, or a scrolling spectrogram, at the display's rate at most,
  from the track's own samples before any conversion for the device; DoP isn't shown. Bench
  rows for CPU while 24/192 FLAC plays with the view shown and hidden, and an old Mac
  checkpoint.
- **Waveform seek bar:** the analysis pass of phase 45 could also store a waveform per track
  for the seek bar.
- **Compressed sync logs:** asked in phase 44 and answered, not built. The sync design
  (ADR 0038) depends on each log being plain appended lines: a push appends the outbox's tail
  and checks that the file is a byte prefix of the outbox, a push that died mid-line continues
  from the file's size, and a reader resumes at a byte offset after the last whole line.
  Compressed, each push would append a gzip member (concatenated members are a valid gzip
  file); the writer would keep the member boundaries to check its prefix, readers would keep
  compressed offsets at member boundaries and drop a torn last member, and both would need a
  decompressor with caps against a compression bomb. About the size of phase 23's log code
  again, in the code that decides what counts twice. JSON lines compress about 8 to 10 times; a
  million plays are about 110 MB plain, so about 12 MB. Worth it when a log passes a few
  hundred MB; not before.
