# Build plan

The roadmap from today's command-line player to the full app. Agents work through it phase by
phase, mostly unattended, and stop only at **hardware checkpoints**, where the owner has to try
something on the DAC Mac, the Denon, a phone, or the 2015 MacBook Pro.

Each phase ends with the [phase gate](#phase-gate): review, performance audit, and architecture
check. A phase isn't done until its gate passes.

## How to run it

Start a session with "run the next phase of docs/plan.md". For several phases unattended, say "use
a workflow to run phases N–M of docs/plan.md". For each phase, the orchestrating agent:

1. **Plans.** It reads the phase, the code it touches, and `docs/map.md`, then writes a short
   implementation plan under the phase heading: files, modules, tests, and order. It does a
   search first (map.md recipes), so it extends existing code instead of writing a second copy.
2. **Implements** on a branch `phase/<n>-<slug>` with an Opus subagent (per the owner's
   CLAUDE.md), in small commits that each pass `./scripts/check`.
3. **Runs the phase gate.** The reviewers and auditors are Sonnet subagents running in parallel.
   It fixes every confirmed finding, then reruns the gate.
4. **Records.** It ticks the phase's boxes, adds a "Result" line with measured numbers, commits,
   and fast-forwards `main` to the branch. It never pushes.
5. **Stops or continues.** At a hardware checkpoint it stops and lists what to push, what to run,
   and what to paste back. Otherwise it moves on to the next phase.

If something blocks a phase that only the owner can resolve (a product decision, missing
hardware, an Apple API that can't do what the phase assumes), stop and ask. Don't work around it.

## Phase gate

Run after every phase, before ticking it off.

- [ ] **Gate:** `./scripts/check` passes.
- [ ] **Code review:** `/code-review high` on the phase branch. Fix confirmed findings in
      their own commits, then rerun the review until it finds nothing new above low severity.
- [ ] **Simplify:** `/simplify` on the same branch. Look especially for duplication across modules
      and for abstractions with one caller.
- [ ] **Performance audit:** `./scripts/bench` against the budgets in
      [Performance budgets](#performance-budgets). A budget miss blocks the phase. A regression
      over 10% against the last recorded result needs a fix or a written reason in the Result
      line.
- [ ] **Real-time audit**, if the phase touched playback: everything reachable from the IO proc
      is C in `HALRender` and uses no locks, no allocation, no logging and no ObjC. Ring buffer
      sizing is justified in a comment.
- [ ] **Architecture audit:** `docs/map.md` still describes the tree. No module reaches around
      another (the tier check only catches tier direction). Settings are read in one place. New
      user-facing strings and constants each have one definition.
- [ ] **Docs:** an ADR in `docs/decisions/` for every non-obvious choice. AGENTS.md boundaries
      updated if the phase created something that must not be edited directly, keeping AGENTS.md
      under ~50 lines.
- [ ] **Result line** written: what shipped, the benchmark numbers, and anything deferred.

## Performance budgets

These are targets for a 43k-track library, measured by `./scripts/bench` on the fixture library
(phase 1). "Old Mac" means the 2015 MacBook Pro on macOS 12, measured at hardware checkpoints.
Change a budget only with a reason in the Result line.

This table is the human copy. Each budget is defined in code next to its benchmark in
`Sources/Tools/Bench`, and the two change together.

| What | Apple Silicon | Old Mac |
|---|---|---|
| Cold launch to an interactive library window | < 1.0 s | < 2.5 s |
| Search-as-you-type, per keystroke (p95) | < 30 ms | < 80 ms |
| Re-sort the track table by any column | < 100 ms | < 250 ms |
| Full scan of the fixture library, local SSD | < 60 s | < 180 s |
| Rescan with no changes, on the NAS | < 30 s | < 60 s |
| Rescan with no changes, fixture library, local SSD | < 5 s | < 15 s |
| Library database for the fixture library | < 60 MB | < 60 MB |
| Memory a scan of the fixture library adds, at its peak | < 50 MB | < 50 MB |
| Browser pane query: genres, artists, albums (p95) | < 20 ms | < 60 ms |
| Resident memory with the library loaded | < 250 MB | < 250 MB |
| CPU while playing 24/192 FLAC | < 2% of a core | < 5% of a core |
| Underruns in a 1-hour playback soak | 0 | 0 |
| Gap between same-format tracks | 0 samples | 0 samples |
| Track change that switches sample rate | < 500 ms | < 500 ms |
| CPU when idle (not playing) | ~0%, no timers firing faster than settings allow | same |
| Load and validate settings, every key changed | < 5 ms | < 20 ms |
| Generate the fixture library | < 30 s | < 120 s |
| Rerun the fixture generator with nothing to do | < 10 s | < 30 s |
| Parse every fixture file's tags, first read in a fresh process | < 5 s | < 20 s |

## Phases

### 1. Foundations: settings, logging, benchmarks, fixtures

Everything later phases measure and configure against.

- [x] **Settings** module (Core): one typed schema holding every setting's key, type, default and
      description. Settings are stored as JSON at `~/Library/Application Support/MusicPlayer/
      settings.json`, and the file holds only the values the user changed. The schema is the
      single source for defaults, the settings window (phase 6) and the command palette. A file
      that doesn't match the schema fails loudly, naming the bad key; it isn't silently replaced
      with defaults.
- [x] **Settings export and import:** export the full effective settings as JSON. Import a JSON
      file as overrides, validating it the same way.
- [x] **Logging** through `os.Logger`, with one subsystem and a category per module. Nothing logs
      from the real-time path.
- [x] **Fixture library generator** (`scripts/fixtures`): builds a 43k-file tree on local disk in
      the shape of a real library (artists, albums, mixed FLAC, ALAC, AAC, WAV, AIFF, MP3, varied
      tags, some with embedded art, a few malformed files). It takes a handful of real tiny
      encoded files (afconvert) and clones them with rewritten tag blocks. Fixture files go in
      `.build/` or `~/Library/Caches`, never in git.
- [x] **Benchmark harness:** a `Bench` executable target and `scripts/bench`. It runs named
      benchmarks, prints a table, and exits non-zero on a budget miss. Each later phase adds its
      own benchmarks. Bench stays out of `./scripts/check`, because it takes too long.

Implementation plan:

1. **Tools tier** (`Sources/Tools`, ADR 0004): tooling that must never link into the app. It may
   import every other tier and nothing imports it. `scripts/arch.swift` and `docs/map.md` learn it.
2. **Log** (Core): `bundleIdentifier` is declared once in Swift and is the log subsystem.
   `scripts/bundle` writes it into the `.app`'s Info.plist, the way it already writes the minimum
   macOS (ADR 0002). `moduleLogger()` takes its category from `#fileID`, so each module gets one.
   HALOutput, Playback and Settings log state changes; the IO proc and the CLI's stdout stay as
   they are.
3. **Settings** (Core): `Setting<Value>` declares key, default, summary and an optional range;
   `AppSettings` holds the declarations as stored properties, enumerated in order (ADR 0003).
   Values: Bool, Int, Double, String, string-backed enums, optionals, lists, and `WatchedFolder`.
   `SettingsStore` loads, validates (unknown key, wrong type, out of range, each naming the key),
   saves only changed values atomically, exports the effective settings and imports overrides.
   The file URL is injected. Seeded with the output device UID, hog mode, watched folders and
   pausing polls during playback.
4. **CLI:** `--export-settings <path>` and `--import-settings <path>` next to `--play`.
5. **Fixtures** (Tools library) and **GenerateFixtures** (Tools executable, `scripts/fixtures`):
   seeds from afconvert (FLAC, ALAC, AAC, WAV, AIFF) plus hand-built silent MP3 frames, since
   macOS has no MP3 encoder. A deterministic plan of artists, albums and discs; per-file tag
   blocks (Vorbis comments + PICTURE, MP4 `ilst`, ID3v2.2/2.3/2.4, RIFF `LIST/INFO`); a set of
   malformed files; `manifest.json` with expected tags and audio properties. Written in parallel,
   skipped when the stored manifest already matches the plan (ADR 0005).
6. **Bench** (Tools executable, `scripts/bench`): `Benchmark` with a `Budget` per machine class,
   defined next to each benchmark. Phase 1 benchmarks: settings load and validate, fixture
   generation for 43k files, and the up-to-date rerun. Budgets join the table above.
7. Tests: LogTests, SettingsTests, FixturesTests (AudioToolbox decodes every valid fixture to the
   seed's samples and reads its tags back), BenchTests (budget selection and miss reporting).

Result: shipped as planned. Bench on Apple Silicon: settings load 0.18 ms (budget 5 ms), generating
43k fixture files 4.49 s (30 s), the up-to-date rerun 1.17 s (10 s). The fixture library is about
550 MB. The review added strict watched-folder keys, CLI errors for flags with no value, one
app-directory constant, and a test that keeps code budgets and this file's table in step. Deferred:
the CLI settings flags have no automated test, and `scripts/bench` builds only for the native arch,
so the phase 5 old-Mac run needs a prebuilt universal `Bench`.

### 2. Tag and format reading

- [x] Our own parsers (no dependencies) for FLAC/Vorbis comments, MP4 atoms (ALAC, AAC), ID3v2.2,
      2.3 and 2.4 (MP3, AIFF, WAV, and DSF later), and WAV `LIST/INFO`. They read the common
      fields, track and disc numbers, compilation and album-artist flags, and embedded art.
- [x] Audio properties from the container: codec, sample rate, bit depth, channels and duration,
      without decoding audio.
- [x] Malformed input never crashes or hangs: tests with truncated, oversized and garbage blocks,
      plus a fuzz test over the fixtures with random byte flips.
- [x] Benchmark: parse 43k fixture files cold.

Implementation plan:

1. **Metadata** (Core): `readMetadata(at:)` returns `TrackMetadata` (tags, audio properties, and
   embedded art as offset, length and MIME type) plus the bytes and reads it took. `readArt(_:at:)`
   reads one picture's bytes. Errors are a typed `MetadataError` with the path, the byte offset and
   what was wrong. One `ByteReader` per file reads through `pread` with a 16 KiB minimum, checks
   every length against the file size before reading, and skips art and audio by length.
2. Parsers, one file each: FLAC (STREAMINFO, Vorbis comment, PICTURE), MP4 (`moov` wherever it
   sits, `stsd` with the ALAC cookie or the AAC `esds`, `mdhd`, `iTunSMPB`, `ilst`), ID3v2.2–2.4
   over any byte range (unsynchronisation, extended header, v2.4 frame flags, footer), MPEG audio
   frames with Xing/Info and VBRI, WAV (`fmt `, `LIST/INFO`, `id3 `) and AIFF/AIFC (`COMM`,
   `ID3 `). The ID3v1 genre list lives here; Fixtures takes it from here instead of its own copy.
3. Tests (`MetadataTests`): every file of a 1000-file fixture library against its manifest entry,
   every malformed file failing with the expected kind, an AudioToolbox cross-check of rate,
   channels and length, hand-built truncated, oversized and garbage blocks per format, ID3
   unsynchronisation and art reads, bytes-read bounds for big art and a trailing `moov`, and a
   seeded byte-flip fuzz over a sample of fixtures.
4. **Bench:** "metadata: parse 43000 fixture files, first read in this process", reporting
   throughput, bytes read per file and the second pass. Benchmarks can attach notes to their row.
5. ADRs for the parser's strictness and I/O, and for what the cold benchmark measures.

Result: shipped as planned. Bench on Apple Silicon: 43k fixture files parsed in 2.29 s (budget 5 s),
about 19k files/s, 8.9 KB read per file in 1.11 reads on average. The second pass matches because
the page cache is warm; a truly cold read needs `sudo purge` (ADR 0007). After the first pass, a
bad field (such as track "A1", bad text encoding, or an iTunes non-syncsafe ID3v2.4 size) became a
per-file warning, not a failure, so messy real tags don't drop tracks. The review fixed truncated
WAV/AIFF bodies, QuickTime `udta` terminators, multi-reference TCON, Xing after a CRC, GIF and
untyped covers, and wide AAC layouts. Deferred: DSF to phase 12.

### 3. Library index and watched folders

- [x] **SQLite** primitive: a thin wrapper over system `libsqlite3` with prepared statements, a
      transaction helper, and errors that throw with the SQL and message.
- [x] **Schema:** tracks, albums, artists, and an FTS5 table for search. Plays, ratings and
      history go in their own tables, so a rescan never touches them. Because of the pre-release
      boundary there are no migrations: a schema mismatch means rebuilding the index, but keep the
      stats tables.
- [x] **Scanner:** a parallel file walk with incremental rescans keyed on path, size and mtime.
      It's NAS-friendly: one stat per file, bounded concurrency, and it can be paused and
      cancelled. Progress is reported, never blocking the UI.
- [x] **Watched folders,** configurable in settings: a list of roots, each with an include/exclude
      pattern list. FSEvents doesn't report changes on SMB volumes, so local roots use FSEvents and
      network roots use a polling rescan at a configurable interval (default 15 minutes, never
      while playback is starting). Optionally pause polling during playback.
- [x] Benchmarks: full scan, no-change rescan, and the query latencies the UI will need.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** scan the real NAS library on the DAC Mac. Report the time,
      the database size, and any files that failed to parse.

Implementation plan:

1. **SQLite** (Primitives): `Database` and `Statement` over the SDK's `SQLite3` module, linked
   with `-lsqlite3`. Open flags, `execute`, prepare, bind, step and read columns, `transaction`,
   and `SQLiteError` carrying the result code, `sqlite3_errmsg` and the SQL. WAL, a busy timeout,
   foreign keys on. Neither type is `Sendable`: one connection per thread or actor.
2. **Metadata:** `MetadataWarning.Kind` and `MetadataError.Kind` get `String` raw values, so the
   index stores each kind by one name.
3. **Library** (Core), schema: `files` (path, size, mtime, failure), `tracks`, `artists`,
   `albums`, `genres`, `warnings`, and an FTS5 `track_search` with prefix indexes. Stats tables
   (`plays`, `ratings`, `history`) are keyed by path and created, not yet written. The SQL of each
   part is its identity, stored in the database: an index mismatch drops and recreates the index
   tables only. SQLite features stop at 3.36 (macOS 12). ADR for linking stats by path.
4. **Library** queries for phase 5: track IDs sorted by any column, FTS prefix search sorted the
   same way, the genre, artist and album panes, and the list of stored warnings and failures.
5. **Scanner:** walks each `WatchedFolder` with `contentsOfDirectory` and prefetched resource
   values (one stat per entry), applies include/exclude globs, compares (path, size, mtime) with
   the index, reads changed files in parallel (fewer workers on network volumes), and writes in
   batched transactions. `ScanControl` pauses and cancels; progress goes to an `AsyncStream`
   continuation buffering only the newest value. A missing, emptied or vanished root, or an
   unreadable directory, removes nothing under it. ADR for the scan's safety rules.
6. **Watcher:** `WatchState` decides what to scan and when (FSEvents subtrees, polls due, the
   playback hook), so tests drive it without timers. `LibraryWatcher` runs it with FSEvents for
   local roots, a one-shot timer for the next poll, and a serial scan queue. The app starts it
   with the folders from Settings.
7. **CLI:** `MusicPlayer --scan <folder> [--db <path>]`, with live progress, a summary, and a
   text file listing every warned or failed file.
8. **Bench:** full scan and no-change rescan of the fixture library, search keystroke p95, sort
   p95, browser pane p95, database size, and resident memory after a scan. Budgets join the table.
9. Tests: SQLiteTests, LibraryTests (schema rebuild keeps stats, queries, scanner incremental and
   removal rules, vanished roots, patterns, pause and cancel, watch state with a fake playback
   engine, one FSEvents round trip).

Follow-up (3b), scan speed on network volumes:

1. **Controller** (Library): `ReadConcurrency`, a pure state machine fed one measured window at
   a time (files/s and seconds per file). Doubles from 4 while throughput rises clearly, then
   holds and probes ±25%, keeping the lowest level that matches the best, and halves when a held
   level's throughput collapses or its latency doubles. Clamped to 2…64 on network volumes;
   local volumes keep the core count. Tests drive it with simulated NAS curves.
2. **Pipeline** (Library): `ScanPipeline` replaces the walk-then-read sequence and
   `concurrentPerform`. Four lister threads walk directories depth-first and queue changed files
   in listing order; reader threads take them under a limit the controller changes mid-scan.
   The empty-root, vanished-root, unreadable-directory and filter rules stay, and removal still
   waits for a walk that finished.
3. **File access seam:** `ScanFileAccess` (list a directory, read tags, volume locality), so the
   bench and tests can scan through `SimulatedNAS` (Fixtures), which adds a fixed latency per
   operation and serves a bounded number at once.
4. **Fewer round trips:** measure Foundation's listing syscalls, `F_RDAHEAD`/`F_NOCACHE` on a
   disk image, and the reads-per-file distribution against the first read size; keep what helps.
5. **Settings and CLI:** `library.networkScanReaders` (null for automatic, or 1…64);
   `--scan … --readers <n>`; the summary prints the readers trace and files/s.
6. **Bench:** a fixture subset through `SimulatedNAS` at 2 ms per operation, adaptive against
   fixed 4, budgeted. ADR 0010 for the controller, the pipeline and the measured tricks.
7. `scripts/bundle release` refuses, with a clear message, a toolchain that can't link x86_64.

### 4. Playback engine

Turns the one-file command into the engine everything else drives.

- [ ] An **output** protocol with two implementations: `HALOutput` now, UPnP in phase 9. The
      engine never knows which one it's driving.
- [ ] **Queue** and a state machine: play, pause, stop, next, previous, seek, repeat and shuffle.
      State changes go out as one observable stream that the UI, media keys and the remote all
      read.
- [ ] **Gapless:** the next track decodes ahead. Same format means no reconfigure and zero gap.
      A rate change reconfigures the device between tracks.
- [ ] **Device handling:** pick the output device in settings, by UID so it survives renames. If
      the device is unplugged, pause and report it rather than switching to the speakers. When it
      reappears, offer to resume.
- [ ] **Volume:** none in the bit-perfect path. An optional digital volume, off by default, says
      plainly that it stops the output being bit-perfect.
- [ ] Restores the device and default outputs on every exit path, as `ExclusiveDevice.close()`
      does today.
- [ ] Benchmarks: playback CPU, a 1-hour soak with underrun count, and gap measurement.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** on the ADI-2, play a gapless album, a playlist mixing
      44.1 and 96 kHz tracks, unplug the DAC during playback, and quit with Ctrl-C. Confirm the
      macOS default output is restored after each.

### 5. Main window

- [ ] AppKit window: a sidebar (library, playlists, watched folders), Swinsian-style column
      browser panes (genre, artist, album), and an `NSTableView` of tracks with configurable,
      sortable and reorderable columns. A now-playing bar with art, seek and time.
- [ ] Search field filtering through FTS5 as you type.
- [ ] Queue view: reorder, remove, and "play next".
- [ ] Album art loaded lazily and cached at display size. No full-size images held in memory.
- [ ] Window layout and column state are saved through Settings.
- [ ] Benchmarks: launch to interactive, search keystroke, re-sort, and memory.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** run the release build on the 2015 MacBook Pro (macOS 12,
      Intel) with the real library. Report launch time and how scrolling and searching feel, and
      run `./scripts/bench` there.

### 6. Commands, shortcuts, command palette, settings window

- [ ] A **command registry**: every user action, including changing each setting, is one command
      with an ID, a title, and an optional default shortcut. Menus, shortcuts, the palette and the
      remote API all read from it. No action exists outside it.
- [ ] **Configurable shortcuts** for every command, stored in settings JSON. Conflicts are
      reported by name, not silently overridden.
- [ ] **⌘K palette:** fuzzy search over commands, settings, tracks, albums, artists and playlists,
      driven only by the keyboard. Results in < 30 ms per keystroke at 43k tracks.
- [ ] **Settings window** generated from the settings schema, so a new setting appears there
      without any UI code.

### 7. Playlists, smart playlists, stats

- [ ] Manual playlists: create, rename, reorder, and add with drag and drop or a command.
- [ ] Smart playlists: a rule editor (field, operator, value; any or all; limit and sort) that
      compiles to SQL. They update live as the library changes.
- [ ] Play counts, skip counts, last played, ratings and a history view, all in SQLite and never
      in files. A play counts after 50% or 4 minutes.
- [ ] Benchmark: evaluating a complex smart playlist over 43k tracks.

### 8. System integration

- [ ] Media keys and headphone controls via `MPRemoteCommandCenter`.
- [ ] Now Playing in Control Center via `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`, with art.
- [ ] Dock menu with the current track and transport controls.

### 9. UPnP/DLNA output (Denon AVR-X1800H)

- [ ] **HTTP server** primitive on Network.framework: serves files with `Range` support, bound to
      the LAN, and only to paths the library knows about.
- [ ] **SSDP discovery** of MediaRenderers, and fetching each renderer's description and
      `GetProtocolInfo` to learn what formats it accepts.
- [ ] A **UPnP output** that implements the phase 4 output protocol, using AVTransport (set URI,
      play, pause, seek, `SetNextAVTransportURI` for gapless) and RenderingControl (volume). It
      sends original file bytes. Formats the renderer can't take are reported, not transcoded.
- [ ] Renderers appear next to HAL devices in the output picker.
- [ ] Info.plist gets `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` and Bonjour entries.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** play 16/44.1, 24/96 and 24/192 FLAC to the Denon. Report
      what its display shows, gapless behavior, seek, and volume.

### 10. Web remote

- [ ] **API:** HTTP plus WebSocket JSON on the phase 9 server. It exposes the command registry,
      playback state, queue, library browsing and search, and pushes state changes to every
      connected client.
- [ ] **Pairing:** a code shown in the app is exchanged for a token. Clients without a token get
      nothing. LAN only, configurable port, and the whole remote can be switched off.
- [ ] **Web app:** static HTML, CSS and JS in `Support/`, with no framework and no build step,
      sized for phones. Now playing, transport, queue, browse and search.
- [ ] Several clients stay in sync with each other and with the Mac UI.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** control playback from a phone and a second computer at
      once, and pair a new device.

### 11. Tag editor

This replaces the read-only boundary in AGENTS.md. Do it first in the phase, with an ADR.

- [ ] **New boundary:** music files are written only through the tag-writer module, only for a
      tag edit the user confirmed, and never by tests against real libraries.
- [ ] **Writers** for FLAC/Vorbis, MP4 and ID3v2.3/2.4, reusing the phase 2 parsers.
- [ ] **Safety:** write to a temp file next to the original, then re-read it and check that the
      audio payload is byte-identical (hash before and after) and that the tags read back as
      written. Replace atomically. Keep an undo journal of the old tag blocks for the last N
      edits. Any check failing leaves the original untouched.
- [ ] **UI:** an editor for one track or a batch, with mixed-value display for multiple
      selection, and art replace and remove.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** edit tags on copies of a few NAS files first, then on real
      ones. Confirm Swinsian and Finder read the results.

### 12. DSD over DoP

- [ ] DSF and DFF parsers, and DSD in the library (rate shown as DSD64, DSD128 or DSD256).
- [ ] DoP packing in Swift on the decode thread, with markers 0x05/0xFA in the top byte. The IO
      proc stays a byte copy.
- [ ] DoP carrier selection: DSD64 at 176.4 kHz, DSD128 at 352.8 kHz, DSD256 at 705.6 kHz. A
      device without the rate is refused, never converted.
- [ ] DSD to the Denon over UPnP, if its `GetProtocolInfo` lists it.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** DSD64, DSD128 and DSD256 on the ADI-2. Its DSD indicator
      lighting is the bit-perfect proof for the whole HAL path.

### 13. Release readiness

- [ ] Developer ID signing, hardened runtime and notarization in `scripts/bundle release`.
      Secrets come from 1Password at that point, so this phase adds the secrets setup it removed.
- [ ] First-run flow: choose watched folders and the output device.
- [ ] Accessibility pass: VoiceOver labels on the table, transport and palette.
- [ ] An app icon and an About window.
- [ ] Remove the **Pre-release** boundary from AGENTS.md if this is the first public release, and
      decide how stored data will be migrated from then on.
- [ ] **Hardware checkpoint (owner):** a clean install on the 2015 MacBook Pro and the DAC Mac
      from a notarized build.

Result: shipped as planned, apart from the owner's checkpoint, which is pending. Bench on Apple Silicon: a full
scan of 43k fixture files takes 2.96 s (budget 60 s), a no-change rescan 0.90 s (5 s), search
keystroke p95 12.6 ms (30 ms), sort p95 43.7 ms (100 ms), pane query p95 0.56 ms (20 ms). The
database is 30 MB (60 MB) and a scan adds 17 MB at its peak (50 MB). The memory row now measures
what a scan adds; the whole-app budget is measured in phase 5. The review fixed an ejected root
emptying the index, a trailing "/" making duplicate tracks, case-only renames, excluded subtrees,
stale ID caches with two scanners, and roots spelled precomposed (ADR 0009). The App now hands
Library its watched folders. Known limit: one subfolder that lists as empty without an error has
its files dropped from the index until it lists again; stats survive.
